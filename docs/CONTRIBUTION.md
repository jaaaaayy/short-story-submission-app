# Git Commit Message Guide

Use this guide to keep commit messages clear and consistent across the project.

## Format

Each commit message should follow this format:

```
<type>: <short summary> (max 50 characters)
```

## Example

```
feat: Add login functionality
```

## 1. Commit Types

Use one of these types to describe your change:

-   **feat**: A new feature for the project.
-   **fix**: A bug fix.
-   **docs**: Documentation-only changes.
-   **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.).
-   **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
-   **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
-   **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
-   **chore**: Changes to the build process, package manager config, or other auxiliary tools.

## 2. Header

Keep the summary short and clear:

-   Use imperative tone (e.g., “Add login” not “Added login”)
-   Capitalize the first word
-   No period at the end
-   Limit to 50 characters

## Tips

-   Keep each commit focused on one change
-   Use the correct type tag
